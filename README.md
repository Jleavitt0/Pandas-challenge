This analysis pulls the data from multiple schools (district & charter) to show how multiple factors may influence the test scores received by students. The factors include the budget each school has, the amount of money that they spend on each student and the amount of students within each school. The analysis is to show if any or all of these factors play a role in the reading and math scores of students throughout these various schools. 

Throughout this analysis you can find the averages of the reading and math scores based off of all these variables. Within you can find the conclusions I have drawn to show which of these variables yield the best results and what may be most important for these schools to focus on in order to have their students yield higher test results.
